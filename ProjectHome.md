QuickTasks is an extended version of the Official Google Tasks™ extension.

To add a task to a specific list in your Google Tasks™, simply select any phrase with your mouse in your browser then right click on it and select your task list. That's it!

QuickTasks also automatically writes the website's URL to the notes section of the task you have just added.

Also you can access the beautiful canvas view of Google Tasks™ by clicking on the QuickTasks icon on your browser for manually adding, removing and editing tasks.

Boost your productivity with QuickTasks!
